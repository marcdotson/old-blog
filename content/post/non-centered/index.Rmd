Continuation from stan-hierarchical. Generate data according to a hierarchical model with covariates in the upper-level.

## Centered

The centered parameterization works as intended.

## Non-centered

The non-centered parameterization still doesn't work as intended, even when reducing the model so that there is a single intercept in the upper-level model.

## Next Steps

- Write out how to conduct the non-centered parameterization as a follow-up to the first post.
- Modify the non-centered parameterization so that it works with a an intercept-only upper-level model.
- Compare with centered model fit using PSIS-LOO.
