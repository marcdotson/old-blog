<p>Continuation from stan-hierarchical. Generate data according to a hierarchical model with covariates in the upper-level.</p>
<div id="centered" class="section level2">
<h2>Centered</h2>
<p>The centered parameterization works as intended.</p>
</div>
<div id="non-centered" class="section level2">
<h2>Non-centered</h2>
<p>The non-centered parameterization still doesnâ€™t work as intended, even when reducing the model so that there is a single intercept in the upper-level model.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-steps" class="section level2">
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write out how to conduct the non-centered parameterization as a follow-up to the first post.</li>
<li>Modify the non-centered parameterization so that it works with a an intercept-only upper-level model.</li>
<li>Compare with centered model fit using PSIS-LOO.</li>
</ul>
